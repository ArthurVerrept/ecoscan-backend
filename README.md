Netscapes backend repo üéâ


<br>
<br>

# Setup
Before running the api, there are a few things we need to download:
1. [Node v12+](https://nodejs.org/en/)
2. [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
3. [pgAdmin](https://www.pgadmin.org/download/)

<br>

### 1. Install & Run Postgresql:
Check you don't already have postgres installed:
```bash
$ postgres -V
```

If you <u>do not</u> have postgres, use homebrew to download it:
```bash
$ brew install postgresql
```
Once it is downloaded, go ahead and run it:
```bash
$ brew services start postgresql
```
### 2. Find Your User:
Firstly enter the postgres db command line by running:
```bash
$ psql postgres
```
Find your user by running:
```bash
$ postgres=# \du
```
This should say return a table with your role name on the left.

### 3. Install pgAdmin and Create Database
- Open pgAdmin (if this is tour first time it will prompt you to create a master password, make this whatever you want)
- Create a new server by right clicking on servers
- In "General" set the name as <b>netscapes-api</b>
- Under "Connection" set the Hostname as <b>localhost</b>
- Set the Username as <b>The role name you found in step 2</b>
- Leave/ set the port as <b>5432</b>

### 3. Tooling Install
[<u>Nestjs cli:</u>](https://docs.nestjs.com/cli/overview)
```bash
$ npm install -g @nestjs/cli
```

[<u>Typeorm cli:</u>](https://github.com/typeorm/typeorm/blob/master/docs/using-cli.md#installing-cli)
```bash
$ npm i -g typeorm
```

[<u>Ts-node:</u>](https://github.com/TypeStrong/ts-node)
```bash
$ npm install -g ts-node
```

### 4. Setup Environment Variables
Finally we can open the actual project!
- Find the <i>".env-example"</i> file in the root of the project, and rename it to <i>".env"</i>.
- Open it and replace <b>username</b> to be your user from step 2

### 5. Install packages
Using npm install the packages required:
```bash
$ npm i
```

### 6. Run Database Migrations
Finally all that's left to do is load the tables:
```bash
$ npm run migration:run
```

## Running the API üèÉ
Run api in watch mode:
```bash
$ npm run start:dev
```

# Development
## Creating new Controllers, Modules, and Services
The easist way to create new controllers, modules and services is to use the nestjs cli. Simply write the command below replacing the necessary parts for your desired file to be generated.
```bash
nest g <schematic> <module-name>
```
This will also hook up all the modules together without you having to do anything.
[Docs for this command](https://docs.nestjs.com/cli/usages#nest-generate)

## Updating the DB
The database tables are created based on what we define in our entities folder. every file that ends with .entity.ts is a db table. Since locally we are using typeorm's synchronize feature it will ‚ú®automagically‚ú® update the postgres database. <br><br>To change a table, simply alter/ create an .entity.ts file and rebuild the dist folder if you are not running in watch mode:
```bash
npm run build
```

However if you wish to work with migrations you must first go to - <i>src/database/database.module.ts</i> and set synchronise to false: <br>
<i>synchronise: false</i>

then you can run:
```bash
npm run migration:generate
```
Once this is finished run to your new migration and change your local database:
```bash
npm run migration:run
```
